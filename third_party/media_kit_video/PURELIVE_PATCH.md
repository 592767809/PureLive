# PureLive media_kit_video patch

- Upstream: `https://github.com/Predidit/media-kit.git`
- Base commit: `803c4a27912091db6f839d48d1b984a0d9f588c7` (2026-09-26, "fix(native): handle unavailable mpv properties safely"; `media_kit` follows the same commit)
- Synced to `6b188ae978808a63e5b58b7ce61f7725238c04c5` (2026-10-14): upstream's only change, "update libmpv video binaries to v1.3.0", applies to `media_kit/hook/native_bundles.json` alone; the arm64, arm and x86_64 bundles here are PureLive's own builds (mpv 0.41.0, FFmpeg 9.0.2), so only the x86 bundle moved to v1.3.0.
- Package version: `media_kit_video 1.2.5`
- License: MIT; the upstream `LICENSE` is retained in this directory.

This revision uses `media_kit`'s Native Assets hook rather than the removed
`media_kit_libs_*` packages. The local patch was replayed with a three-way
merge against the new upstream video implementation. Android JNI references
now call the helper class shipped by `media_kit` directly. The unused upstream
`deletedGlobalObjectRefs` field was dropped; reference deletion remains
serialized by the existing Surface owner and delayed teardown.

## Why this copy exists

On Android, `AndroidVideoController` owns the `vo`, `wid` and Surface lifecycle.
PureLive's room-scoped audio mode also needs to select `vid=no` without replacing
the player or reopening the live stream. Sending that property independently
could race a rotation, PiP or Surface resize update and leave the UI waiting for
a video track or Surface that had already vanished.

This patch adds `VideoController.setVideoOutputEnabled` and makes the Android
controller the single owner of both the requested video-output state and the
Surface lifecycle. Track properties are issued from the controller's lock via
media_kit's asynchronous mpv request. The synchronous string-property FFI call
is deliberately avoided for headphone switching because a busy live demuxer
can block Flutter's isolate before the audio presentation or timeout paints.
Video mode always selects `vid=auto`, including while WID is temporarily zero;
only an explicit audio-only request selects `vid=no`. This avoids a startup
deadlock where disabling video before a Surface callback also prevented the
callback that would restore it. Surface replacement follows Flutter's
`SurfaceProducer` contract: every availability/resize queries `getSurface()`, a
changed Java Surface receives a new JNI global reference, and the old WID is
detached exactly once before delayed reference deletion. Geometry-only updates
do not reset `vo`, and Surface changes do not seek a live stream merely to
refresh rendering. The Android Surface-size MethodChannel request remains
outside the controller lock. Desktop platforms retain media_kit's existing
`setVideoTrack` behavior.

On Windows, PureLive also exposes a throttled `frameRevision` liveness signal.
The native D3D11 mailbox emits it only after a fence-confirmed frame has been
promoted for Flutter consumption; software rendering emits it after a completed
render. This lets `PlayerManager` distinguish “libmpv still says playing” from
“the presentation surface has stopped advancing”, recreate the renderer once,
then fall through to the existing CDN-line recovery. The signal carries no
pixels, is limited to two events per second, and does not alter normal frame
delivery or aspect-ratio policy.

`VideoController.setSize` also accepts an opt-in `force` flag on every platform
(only the Windows native implementation changes behavior). PureLive uses it on
the first layout after a Windows `Texture` remount so the current native output
receives a viewport even when its controller cache still contains equal width
and height. Normal resize calls keep the upstream equality fast path. Together
with the frame-progress fence, this prevents a 0×0 replacement output from
being treated as presentation-ready after an overlay route or transport retry.

## Maintenance

When updating the pinned media-kit revision:

1. Replace this directory with the new upstream package.
2. Reapply the controller API, Android state-owner patch, and Windows
   fence-confirmed frame-progress callback.
3. Compare every file against the new upstream commit; only the files described
   above, `pubspec.yaml`, this note and the policy helper should differ.
4. Run `flutter analyze`, the full test suite, Windows release build and Android
   ARM64 release build.
5. On Android, repeat video/audio toggles plus rotation, PiP and room re-entry.
6. On Windows, verify a deliberately stalled renderer is recreated once, a
   stalled CDN advances to the next line, a 0×0 candidate never replaces the
   active texture, remounting reasserts viewport size, and explicit pause never
   triggers the watchdog.

## iOS: no OpenGL ES frame in the background (2026-10-18)

`ios/.../plugin/TextureHW.swift` skips `render` while the app is in the
background (`AppVisibility`, following `didEnterBackground` /
`willEnterForeground`). iOS ends an app that issues OpenGL ES commands in the
background; with PureLive's background play (A18.1 c5) mpv keeps playing the
sound and the next frame is drawn once the app is back. The simulator's
software path (`TextureSW`) has no GL and is unchanged.

## Android initialization ordering (2026-10-30)

Initial mpv options and Surface attachment now share the controller lock.
A Surface published before the Create reply is retained and replayed after
initialization, so the startup vo=null cannot overwrite a valid gpu binding.
Creation still does not wait for a Surface. The application keys Video by its
controller because VideoState binds player width/height streams in initState;
replacing a native player must replace those listeners too. Factory race tests
and Android 9 generated-media native/screen comparisons cover both paths.

## Independent native player queues (2026-10-30)

The companion `media_kit` NativePlayer lock is instance-owned. Upstream's
static lock serialized every player's create/open/control/dispose operation,
so a held stop reply in a retired player also blocked its replacement from
initializing. The session's bounded retirement alone could not bypass that
shared queue. Each player's existing serialization and native event-buffer
ownership remain intact. The real-handle regression
`packages/live_player/test/native_instance_isolation_test.dart` holds an old
stop reply during disposal and requires a replacement to initialize, change
volume and pause before releasing the old reply. The original shared lock
times out; the instance lock passes. This is an identified common defect,
not original Sony/Huawei/Honor hardware acceptance.
